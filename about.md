His responsibilities include helping to [plan](https://bampfa.org/news/off-the-shelves-digitizing-filmmaker-recordings-cassette-tape) and [manage](https://bampfa.org/news/neh-grant-will-support-preservation-tvtv-archives) digitization [projects](https://cinefiles.bampfa.berkeley.edu/), film and video cataloging, overseeing the image management system for the museum, and advocating for better living through metadata.

Recently he designed and implemented a [webapp](https://github.com/BAM-PFA/edith) to perform digital preservation tasks on AV material at BAMPFA, and enjoys tinkering with Python to [do](https://github.com/BAM-PFA/magickMARCer) neat [stuff](https://github.com/BAM-PFA/csvboy).
