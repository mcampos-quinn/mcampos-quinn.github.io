Miriam Campos-Quinn is the Director of Library Special Projects at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive's Film Library and Study Center.

Their responsibilities include helping to [plan](https://bampfa.org/news/off-the-shelves-digitizing-filmmaker-recordings-cassette-tape) and [manage](https://bampfa.org/news/neh-grant-will-support-preservation-tvtv-archives) digitization [projects](https://cinefiles.bampfa.berkeley.edu/), film and video cataloging, overseeing the image management system for the museum, and advocating for better living through metadata. They are responsible for managing various grant funded projects, supervising a team of over-qualified and underpaid work study undergraduates, and scheming ways to better engage the Library with campus, with our local art and film [communities](https://mcampos-quinn.github.io/2020/01/08/subjects-for-further-research.html), and with our general public.

They designed and implemented a [webapp](https://github.com/BAM-PFA/edith) to perform digital preservation tasks on AV material at BAMPFA, and enjoy tinkering with Python to [do](https://github.com/BAM-PFA/magickMARCer) neat [stuff](https://github.com/BAM-PFA/csvboy). They hold an MLIS from San Jos√© State University and a BA in Film Studies from UC Berkeley.
