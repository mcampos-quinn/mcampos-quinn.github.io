Michael Campos-Quinn is the Metadata & Digital Asset Manager at the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive, where his responsibilities include film and video cataloging, overseeing the image management system for the museum, helping to plan and manage digitization projects, and advocating for better living through metadata. Most recently he has designed and implemented a [webapp](https://github.com/BAM-PFA/edith) to perform digital preservation tasks on AV material at BAMPFA, and enjoys finding low-barrier ways to automate our work as archivists. He holds an MLIS from San Jos√© State University and a BA in Film Studies from UC Berkeley.
