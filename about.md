Michael Campos-Quinn is the Interim Director of the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive's Film Library and Study Center, as well as the Metadata & Digital Asset Manager for the institution. 

His responsibilities include film and video cataloging, overseeing the image management system for the museum, helping to plan and manage digitization projects, and advocating for better living through metadata. As Interim Library Director, he is responsible for managing various grant funded digitization projects, supervising a team of over-qualified and underpaid work study undergraduates, and scheming ways to better engage the Library with campus, with our local art and film communities, and with our general public.

Recently he designed and implemented a [webapp](https://github.com/BAM-PFA/edith) to perform digital preservation tasks on AV material at BAMPFA, and enjoys tinkering with Python to [do](https://github.com/BAM-PFA/magickMARCer) neat [stuff](https://github.com/BAM-PFA/csvboy). He holds an MLIS from San Jos√© State University and a BA in Film Studies from UC Berkeley.
