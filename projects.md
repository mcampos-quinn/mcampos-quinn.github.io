# heartfilm <3

2020-

github repo [here](https://github.com/mcampos-quinn/heartfilm)

![heartrate activated shutter trigger](/images/projects/heart.gif)

In process! I also don't think the title of the film will actually be *heartfilm* but it's fine for now. This is intended for a diary/self portrait film of reflection during COVID-19. **Update** I recognized after I wrote this that no one gives a shit about my COVID reflections, but I'm still looking for a way to use this technique that's engaging and rigorous (enough).

I'm using an LED pulse sensor to drive a GIPO pin on an *ItsyBitsy* microcontroller from Adafruit. When my pulse triggers the monitor, the GPIO pin goes to ground and completes the circuit on the single-frame shutter trigger. VoilÃ ! Here's a circuit diagram:

Other ideas of course involve using the trigger to film something based on some stream of data. It's pretty open ended!

# Garden cycle

2020-

I've been shooting [super8](https://vimeo.com/392847863) and [16mm](https://vimeo.com/397312531) film in the UC Berkeley Botanical Garden. I'm not... totally sure what I will end up with yet, but I had this vision in my head for years of a stop-motion flicker film of just blossoms.

That isn't entirely how it has worked out so far, but I think it's getting much more interesting. I have spent a huge amount of time at the garden (I used to ride my bike up to it a few times a week for lunch), so I feel intimately familiar with the grounds, the collection, and some of the horticulturists. I'm especially interested now in the human labor involved in producing multitudinous immersive "natures" that each lay claim to representing a particular biome. The frame grab below is from a pair of Ohlone grinding stones on display, a signifier of a different kind of labor performed on the environment that is now the garden, and part of a set of local Native American tools and artifacts on display.

# TVTV

2018-

This is such an incredible [project](https://bampfa.org/news/neh-grant-will-support-preservation-tvtv-archives) for me to work on now, since it spans basically my entire professional library/archive/whatever career. One of the projects I worked on as an intern at the PFA Library while I was in grad school was making a [finding aid](https://oac.cdlib.org/findaid/ark:/13030/c87m0fns/) for the TVTV paper collection.

I worked on various iterations of this grant (BAMFPA applied 3 times) and wrote the metadata and preservation plans for the successful NEH grant, and have been supervising the project assistants (there have been two so far, with another on deck :/), and now am *de facto* managing the entire rest of the project. We launched it publicly with a dedicated [website](https://guerrillatv.bampfa.berkeley.edu/) that I made ahead of the 2020 presidential conventions and I covered the PR, arranged interviews with TVTV members by Steve Seid, corralled the writers we commissioned, etc. etc. There's still some left to do, though, mostly put off by COVID: a bit of remaining video digitization QC, lots of metadata QC, getting some additional press coverage, adding more detail to the website... and so on.

Anyway I'm stoked on it as a hugely relevant set of historical documents for this time (2020 being another banner year for fucked up politics). It's a sprawling project with many moving parts (and a $250k budget), so it's been challenging and once complete will be a hugely rewarding effort. So... "type 2 fun."

# EDITH

2017-

[This](https://github.com/BAM-PFA/edith) was/is an incredible learning experience full of valuable lessons, not the least of which is "don't do this again." I made a digital preservation repository for BAMPFA's digital AV material, based on work at CUNY and IFI and using ResourceSpace as a front end. It works, mostly, which is great! It's also a huge technical challenge and a timesuck of as much energy as I care to throw at it.  But hey, it works!
